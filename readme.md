## Reflection

This is my personal project to learn Node.js and MongoDB

Since the popularity of Node.js and MongoDB has increased, I am interested in this project.

Because I have others' commitments and responsibilities I tried to do it during my free time

Moreover, this is a great way to learn and implement Node.js and MongoDB since it uses a lot of feature of the frameworks.
